## 🎨 GUI Design Choices

| Component       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎯 Framework    | Built using Python’s built-in Tkinter library for easy deployment           |
| 🧠 Structure     | Uses separate functions (`count_words`, `on_submit`) for modular design     |
| 🚫 Error Handling | Gracefully handles empty input by returning 0                              |
| 👁️ UX Design    | Includes a label, entry field, submit button, and result output label       |

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The user enters text into the entry field.
2. On clicking "Submit", the app counts words using regex.
3. The total word count is displayed below the button.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (built-in GUI framework)
- re (regular expressions for word detection)

---

## ⚠️ Known Challenges

- 🧩 Regex may be complex for beginners, but offers efficient word extraction
- 🎨 Tkinter has limited styling capabilities (for advanced UI, explore PyQt or customTkinter)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add character count or sentence analysis
- Implement real-time text monitoring
- Improve styling with themes or alternative GUI frameworks
- Add support for file input and saving results

## 📄 Code Organization

| Function        | Role                                               |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| count_words()   | Uses regex to calculate number of words            |
| on_submit()     | Callback function triggered by button click        |
